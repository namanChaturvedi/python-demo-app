# Python Flask - Demo Web Application

This is a simple Python Flask web application. The app provides system information and a realtime monitoring screen with dials showing CPU, memory, IO and process information.

The app has been designed with cloud native demos & containers in mind, in order to provide a real working application for deployment, something more than "hello-world" but with the minimum of pre-reqs. It is not intended as a complete example of a fully functioning architecture or complex software design.

Typical uses would be deployment to Kubernetes, demos of Docker, CI/CD (build pipelines are provided), deployment to cloud (Azure) monitoring, auto-scaling

## Building & Running Locally

### Pre-reqs

- Be using Linux, WSL or MacOS, with bash, make etc
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - for running locally, linting, running tests etc
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - for running as a container, or image build and push

Clone the project to any directory where you do development work

```
git clone https://github.com/namanChaturvedi/cicd_demo.git
```

### Makefile

A standard GNU Make file is provided to help with running and building locally.

```text
help                 💬 This help message
lint                 🔎 Lint & format, will not fix but sets exit code on error
lint-fix             📜 Lint & format, will try to fix errors and modify code
image                🔨 Build container image from Dockerfile
push                 📤 Push container image to registry
run                  🏃 Run the server locally using Python & Flask
test                 🎯 Unit tests for Flask app
test-report          🎯 Unit tests for Flask app (with report output)
test-api             🚦 Run integration API tests, server must be running
clean                🧹 Clean up project
```

Make file variables and default values, pass these in when calling `make`, e.g. `make image IMAGE_REPO=blah/foo`

| Makefile Variable | Default                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------      |
| IMAGE_REG         | <REGISTRY_LINK>        |
| IMAGE_REPO        | <IMAGE_REPO_PATH>     |
| IMAGE_TAG         | latest                      |

The app runs under Flask and listens on port 5000 by default, this can be changed with the `PORT` environmental variable.

# Containers

Public container image is [available on Container Registry](https://google.com)

Run in a container with:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 docker.io/cicd-demo/cicd-demo
```

Should you want to build your own container, use `make image` and the above variables to customise the name & tag.

## Kubernetes

The app can easily be deployed to Kubernetes using Helm, see [deploy/kubernetes/readme.md](deploy/kubernetes/readme.md) for details
